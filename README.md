## üìñ Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between **age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), and blood pressure** among patients at **Kericho Level 5 Hospital (2016‚Äì2021)**.  
Regression analysis is employed to evaluate whether BMI and age significantly predict hypertension levels (systolic and diastolic blood pressure).  

The project is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the degree **Bachelor of Science in Statistics** at Kirinyaga University.

## Chapter 1: Introduction
- **Background:** High blood pressure is strongly linked with BMI. Increasing weight often increases the risk of hypertension, which in turn raises the risk of heart disease, kidney failure, and stroke.  
- **Problem Statement:** Gaps exist in understanding how socio-economic factors and BMI interact with blood pressure.  
- **Purpose:** To assess the relationship between BMI, age, and gender with blood pressure using regression analysis.  
- **Hypotheses:** Tested positive/negative correlations between BP, age, gender, and BMI.  
- **Significance:** Helps in developing better hypertension prevention and management strategies.  

---

## Chapter 2: Literature Review
- Overview of hypertension, causes, and risks.  
- Relationship between blood pressure and lifestyle factors.  
- Review of Body Mass Index (BMI) categories and trends.  
- Age-related vascular changes affecting blood pressure.  

---

## Chapter 3: Research Methodology
- **Design:** Descriptive case study.  
- **Population:** Hypertensive patients at Kericho Level 5 Hospital.  
- **Data Source:** Secondary data (hospital records 2016‚Äì2021).  
- **Analysis:** Regression models using R software.  
- **Variables:**  
  - Dependent: Blood Pressure (systolic & diastolic).  
  - Independent: Age, Gender, BMI.  

---

## Chapter 4: Results and Discussion
- **Summary Statistics:**  
  - BMI: 25.52 (overweight) ‚Äì 49.38 (obese).  
  - Systolic BP: 120‚Äì150 mmHg.  
  - Diastolic BP: 87‚Äì148 mmHg.  
  - Age: 30‚Äì87 years.  

- **Regression Models:**  
  - Systolic BP: R¬≤ = 55.07% (explained by BMI & Age).  
  - Diastolic BP: R¬≤ = 91.8% (explained by BMI & Age).  

- **Findings:**  
  - Strong relationship between BMI, age, and BP.  
  - BMI significantly influences hypertension risk.  
  - Both models statistically significant.  

---

## Chapter 5: Summary, Conclusion & Recommendations
- **Summary:** Hypertension is strongly associated with BMI and age. Regression confirmed significant predictive power.  
- **Conclusion:** Overweight and obese individuals face higher hypertension risks. Early interventions are crucial.  
- **Recommendations:**  
  - Public health interventions should target weight reduction.  
  - Regular monitoring and lifestyle adjustments for at-risk groups.  
  - Further studies should include more socio-economic variables.

# 4.1 Importing Data from Excel and Extracting Variables

The data to be examined is initially entered into Excel (or CSV) and then exported to R for analysis.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
# Extract each variable
blood_pressure <- data$blood_pressure
age <- data$age
weight <- data$weight
cholesterol <- data$cholesterol
library(car)

# Fit a regression model
model <- lm(blood_pressure ~ age + weight + cholesterol, data = data)

# Check Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
vif(model)
